# market_analysis

# Summary
This application utilizes machine learning (e.g. genetic algorithm) to converge on a hypothesis function that most closely resembles the transfer function of some set of inputs and an output. The goal of modeling the transfer function enables one to gain insight into the correlation of the features/variables present. This insight will guide financial decisions on a national scale as well as on domestic market scales.

# Application
Insight into correlation between sets of features can enable more informed decisions within the financial sector. Take for example a hedge fund which `hedges` multiple asset classes together.
